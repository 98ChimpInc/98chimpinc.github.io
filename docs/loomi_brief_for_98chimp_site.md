# Loomi — Product Brief for 98chimp.com

> **Purpose:** Give the developer building 98chimp.com everything they need to add Loomi as a product on the site — positioning, narrative, copy direction, and how it connects to the existing three products.

---

## Why Loomi Belongs on 98chimp.com

The three existing products (DK Derby, BrainFit, Unison) help adults see themselves more clearly. Loomi works at the other end of the timeline — before the gaps form. It helps children build confidence, self-worth, and emotional resilience during the window when the brain is most open to it: right before sleep.

Together, the four products tell a complete story: 98%Chimp builds neuroscience-grounded tools for every stage of self-awareness — from the foundations laid in early childhood, to the recalibrations needed in adulthood.

## What Loomi Is

An audio-first bedtime story app for children ages 0–6. Parents start a story, place the phone face-down, and the child drifts to sleep. Professionally narrated stories have positive affirmations woven naturally into the dialogue — not as lists, but dissolved into the narrative so children absorb confidence-building messages without knowing they're being taught anything.

Stories play over a soft lullaby melody. When the narration ends, the melody continues until the sleep timer runs out. The whole experience is designed to be started and forgotten — anti-screen-time by design.

**Status:** Closed TestFlight Beta (Feb 2026)
**Own brand:** [loomi.kids](https://www.loomi.kids)
**Team:** Built by all three Zangenehpour brothers — Shahin (neuroscience), Soushiant (social science), Shawn (business strategy) — all dads.

## The Loomi Formula

Three pillars, each backed by peer-reviewed research:

1. **Storytelling** — Builds language, imagination, and bonding rituals
2. **Affirmations** — Shapes identity through repetition during formative years; grows confidence and eases anxiety
3. **Deep Sleep** — Supports memory consolidation, growth, immunity, and emotional resilience

The landing page cites 8 studies from: *Sleep*, *Science*, *PLoS ONE*, *Social Cognitive & Affective Neuroscience*, *Annual Review of Psychology*, *Healthcare*, and *Scientific Reports*.

## How Loomi Fits the 98%Chimp Thesis

The site's thesis: *"The brain is not a fixed thing. Neither are you."*

Each product maps to this:

| Product | What gap it closes |
|---|---|
| **DK Derby** | The gap between what you *think* you know and what you *actually* know |
| **BrainFit** | The gap between what you *feel* and what you *understand* about what you feel |
| **Unison** | The gap between what you *hear* in your head and what *comes out* |
| **Loomi** | Builds the foundation *before* those gaps widen — shaping confidence, self-worth, and emotional resilience in the years when neural pathways are most plastic |

Loomi is the only product aimed at children, and the only one with co-founders beyond Shahin. But it shares the same root: neuroscience applied to a real human need.

## Product Card Copy (ready to use)

Written to match the existing card voice — conversational, science-grounded, uses `...` for rhythm, ~3 sentences:

### Option A (emphasizes the science angle)

```
Tag:    Now in Beta · Children's Sleep & Development
Title:  Loomi
Copy:   Bedtime stories with a secret ingredient. Positive affirmations woven so
        naturally into the narrative that children absorb confidence-building messages
        without realizing it... right before sleep, when the brain is most open to
        belief-building. Audio-first, screen-off, science-backed.
CTA:    Explore Loomi → (link to loomi.kids)
Emoji:  🌙
```

### Option B (emphasizes the parenting angle)

```
Tag:    Now in Beta · Children's Sleep & Development
Title:  Loomi
Copy:   What if bedtime could build your child's confidence while they sleep? Loomi
        weaves positive affirmations into professionally narrated stories — not as
        lists, but as natural dialogue... building resilience, self-worth, and calm,
        one bedtime at a time. Built by three dads who needed it for their own daughters.

### Option C (shortest, matches DK Derby's punchy style)

```
Tag:    Now in Beta · Children's Sleep & Development
Title:  Loomi
Copy:   Stories that build confidence while they lull to sleep. Positive affirmations
        dissolved into bedtime narratives, played over soft melodies... designed to be
        started and forgotten. Neuroscience has never sounded this much like a lullaby.

## Design Considerations for the Card

Loomi's own brand is dark navy (#0A0E1F) with purple accents (#A78BFA) — visually opposite to the 98chimp cream/orange palette. For the product card on 98chimp.com:

- The card should use the 98chimp design system (cream, Cormorant Garamond headings, DM Sans body) — not Loomi's dark theme
- The `product-visual` panel could use a deep navy or dark purple background (`data-bg="LM"` or similar) to hint at Loomi's own aesthetic without breaking the page
- 🌙 (crescent moon) is the natural emoji — it matches the bear-hugging-moon logo and the bedtime concept
- Consider a `card-reverse` layout (visual on left, content on right) to alternate with whatever card precedes it

## What Makes Loomi Different from the Other Three

The developer should understand these distinctions when integrating:

- **Audience:** The other three products are for adults. Loomi is for parents of young children (0–6).
- **Team:** DK Derby, BrainFit, and Unison are Shahin's solo projects. Loomi is a collaboration with his brothers Soushiant and Shawn — three dads building for their own daughters.
- **Philosophy:** The adult tools help you *see yourself clearly*. Loomi helps children *build the foundation* before self-awareness gaps form.
- **Own brand:** Loomi has its own landing page (loomi.kids), its own visual identity, and its own GitHub org (TricycleLabz). The 98chimp card should link out to loomi.kids rather than trying to contain all the Loomi content.

## The Brothers Story (for About section expansion)

The current About section features Shahin alone ("The Founder"). If Loomi is added, there's an opportunity to expand this to acknowledge the full team — or to add a brief note like:

> *"Loomi is built with my brothers Soushiant (social scientist) and Shawn (business strategist) — three dads who asked: what if technology could nurture our kids instead of distracting them?"*

This could be a line in the Loomi card itself, or a small expansion of the About section. The "three brothers, three dads" narrative is one of Loomi's strongest differentiators and shouldn't be buried.

---

## Key Loomi Copy (for reference)

These are from existing Loomi materials — useful if the developer needs to write additional copy:

- **Central question:** *"What if technology could nurture our kids and develop their best traits — instead of distracting and exploiting them?"*
- **Vision:** *"Grounded in science. Designed for calm. An app that turns bedtime into a moment of emotional and psychological development."*
- **Personal stake:** *"We built this for our daughters. And now, we're sharing it with you."*
- **Impact:** *"Helping children internalize confidence, self-worth, and emotional resilience — right before sleep, when the brain is most open to belief-building."*
- **Landing page tagline:** *"The Science of Calm & Confident Kids"*
- **Footer:** *"Built with ❤️ by 3 brothers and dads for parents seeking peaceful bedtimes."*
