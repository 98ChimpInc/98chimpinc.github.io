**Format:** Narrative memoir podcast — immersive, literary, emotionally rich
**Episode Length:** 20–30 minutes
**Release:** Seasonal with planned return after hiatus
**Status:** 3 episodes launched, distributed, and well-received. Currently in intentional hiatus. Return in active planning.

## THE ORIGIN STORY (Core Brand Narrative)

The podcast name carries dual symbolism drawn from the host's lived experience. Shahin — meaning falcon in Persian — represents vision, precision, and clarity of mind. The whale emerged from a sacred medicine ceremony, teaching the practice of going deep: one breath, one dive, one act of courage at a time.

The show lives in the space between those two archetypes: **vision and depth, mind and body, science and soul.** This isn't just a name — it's a philosophy and a framework the host returns to throughout every episode.

---

## THE HOST

Shahin is a man of rare range. His life has unfolded across multiple acts — each one a reinvention, each one adding a new layer to who he is as a storyteller and human being.

**Background highlights relevant to brand identity:**

- Born in Iran. Escaped illegally on foot through mountains into Turkey at age 19 during the Iran-Iraq war era. Eventually arrived in Canada — the journey that forms the spine of Season 1.
- Built an academic and scientific career after arriving in Canada, followed by a significant professional disruption and reinvention — the arc of Seasons 2 and beyond.
- Currently serving as **Mobile Principal Engineer at TELUS** — a senior technical leadership role, representing the latest chapter of professional reinvention and altitude.
- An active student of music: currently developing skills in **singing, Santour, Setar, and Oud** — traditional Persian and Middle Eastern instruments. This is not a hobby; it is a deepening of the same cultural and spiritual roots that animate the podcast.
- Has undergone meaningful personal and spiritual transformation, including sacred medicine experiences, which inform both the show's philosophy and its emotional vocabulary.

**The host is not someone who talks about transformation from the outside. He is someone who keeps living it — in real time.**

This should be felt in every design and copy decision made for this brand.

## WHAT HAS BEEN CREATED & LAUNCHED

| Episode | Title | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| 00 | The Escape | ✅ Launched & distributed |
| 01 | The Crossing | ✅ Launched & distributed |
| 02 | The Valley Between | ✅ Launched & distributed |

All three episodes have been well-received by early listeners. Audience feedback has included comments such as *"You're not just telling a hero's journey — you're telling the path of the mystic"* and *"This is the first time I've felt my own story mirrored back to me."*

### Episodes in Development (Remaining Season 1)

| Episode | Title | Theme |
|---------|-------|--------|
| 03 | New Land | Arrival in Canada |
| 04 | Scientific Pursuits | Building a new life |
| 05 | Academic Rise | Professional ascent |
| 06 | The Fall | Academic career disruption |
| 07 | Reinvention | Career transformation |
| 08 | Family Crisis | Personal reckoning |
| 09 | The Healing Journey | The inner work |
| 10 | Integration & New Beginning | Full circle |

### Seasons 2, 3 & Beyond
Season 2 and beyond are in early conceptual planning. The show has ambitions beyond a single season — the host's life contains enough distinct chapters, transformations, and themes to sustain a multi-season arc. Design decisions should not box the brand into a "one-story" identity. The landing page should feel expansive enough to grow.

---

## CONTENT ARCHITECTURE & STORYTELLING STYLE

Each episode follows a consistent structure:
1. Opening Ney music + whispered intro
2. Brief disclaimer (personal story, not prescription)
3. Episode-specific hook
4. Four-act narrative structure
5. Closing reflection + preview of next episode
6. Outro

**Signature elements woven throughout:**
- Raw, sensory-rich storytelling (smell, sound, texture, temperature)
- Reflective, philosophical observations often rooted in Sufism
- Scientific and neurological insights woven naturally into narrative
- The Falcon/Whale metaphor as a recurring touchstone

---

## SOUND DESIGN IDENTITY

- **Opening/closing theme:** Traditional Persian Ney flute
- **Act transitions:** Nature-based ambient cues — wind, heartbeat, breath, water, snow
- **Original music (emerging):** The host is actively developing skills in Santour, Setar, and Oud — with the intention to eventually incorporate original compositions into the show. This is a significant brand differentiator: a memoirist who scores his own story.
- **Voice:** Intimate, close-mic narration. The listener should feel they are in the same room.

---

## BRAND AESTHETIC & TONE DIRECTION

The visual and verbal identity should feel like the intersection of:

- **Ancient and modern** — Persian cultural roots meeting contemporary storytelling
- **Intimate and cinematic** — whispered narration, immersive soundscapes, literary prose
- **Spiritual but grounded** — Sufi philosophy, neuroscience, and raw human experience coexist
- **Masculine warmth** — strength, vulnerability, and wisdom without sentimentality
- **Life in motion** — this is not a static brand; the host keeps growing, and the design should feel like it has room to evolve

**Color palette suggestions:** Deep midnight blue, warm amber/saffron, aged parchment, slate grey. Avoid anything clinical, corporate, or trendy.

**Typography direction:** Serif or calligraphic accents for headings (evoking Persian script influence), clean modern sans-serif for body. Nothing casual or playful.

**Imagery direction:** Mountains, open skies, lone figures in vast landscapes, candlelight, hands on instruments, the threshold between darkness and dawn. Avoid stock-photo genericness at all costs.

---

## AUDIENCE & POSITIONING

**Primary audience:** People navigating reinvention — immigrants, career transitioners, spiritual seekers, anyone who has had to rebuild identity from the ground up.

**Secondary audience:** Fans of literary narrative podcasting, Persian and Middle Eastern diaspora communities, professionals who also carry a rich inner life.

**Positioning statement:** *This is not a self-help podcast. It's a lived testimony. The kind of story that doesn't tell you what to do — it reminds you that transformation is possible because someone else has already walked through fire and come back to tell you about it.*

**Comparable shows in spirit (not format):** This American Life, On Being with Krista Tippett, Moth Radio Hour.

## LANDING PAGE ARCHITECTURE (Recommended for Claude Code)

Sections in recommended order:

1. **Hero** — Podcast name, one-line brand statement, prominent "Listen Now" CTA with embedded player. Should feel immediate and immersive — not like a brochure.

2. **The Name** — A brief, beautifully written explanation of the Falcon & Whale symbolism. This is the philosophical anchor of the brand and deserves its own moment.

3. **About the Host** — Shahin's story in 3–4 sentences. Lead with the human being, not the credentials. Photo essential. The TELUS role can be mentioned as context for the current hiatus and return — it signals credibility without being the point.

4. **The Journey** — Visual episode map or scrollable season arc showing Season 1 episodes, with indicators for what's live vs. coming soon. Should convey that this is an ongoing, evolving story — not a finished product.

5. **Listen** — Featured episode player. Episode 00 as default. Clean, uncluttered.

6. **The Music** (optional but recommended) — A brief section acknowledging the host's musical journey (Santour, Setar, Oud, singing) and the intention to weave original music into the show. This is a rare differentiator and deserves visibility.

7. **Community / Patreon** — Early supporter invitation. Warm, not transactional in tone.

8. **Newsletter / Stay Connected** — Simple, low-friction. Frame it as "walk this journey with me" rather than "subscribe."

9. **Footer** — Platform links (Spotify, Apple Podcasts, etc.), social, contact.

## COPY TONE GUIDELINES FOR CLAUDE CODE

When generating or placing any copy on this site:

- Write in the **second person singular** where possible — speak directly to one person, not a crowd
- Avoid podcast clichés ("tune in," "subscribe and leave a review," "join our community")
- Favor **poetic restraint** over explanation — let the listener lean in
- The hiatus should be framed honestly if mentioned: not as an absence, but as the host living the next chapters before telling them
- Every line of copy should feel like it could belong in the podcast itself

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES SUMMARY (TL;DR for Claude Code)

> Build something that feels like standing at the threshold between two worlds — one left behind, one not yet arrived. Ancient and alive. Personal and universal. A site where a stranger lands and immediately understands: *this person has lived something, and they've come back to tell me about it.*
